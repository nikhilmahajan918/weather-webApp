# Weather Web Appliaction

This weather web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve used the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather details of the user's entered city. I used the opencagedata api to retrieve the user's current city for the current location. 

# Cool Features of this Weather Web Application

- Press the 'Enter' key inside the input field to trigger the search button.
- Fetch the user's current location weather if the geolocation API is supported by the user's browser.
- Change the background based on the inputted / current location city.
- The user will get many weather details in this app, such as temperature in Celsius, weather conditions, location, wind speed, and humidity.
